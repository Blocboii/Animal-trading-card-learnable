            <article> <p>What are Tibetan Mastiffs known for <br></p>
                Tibetan Mastiff Dog Breed are watchful, aloof, imposing, and intimidating: The ancient Tibetan Mastiff is the guardian dog supreme. These densely-coated giants are mellow and calm around the house, sweetly devoted to family, and aloof and territorial with strangers.

            <p>I love dogs! A tibetan mastiff is my dream dog and hopefully i will be able to get a dog like this. However, they are very protective, stubborn and have a personality that makes it hard for you as the owner to strictly make them obey...unless of course you train them strictly from young.
